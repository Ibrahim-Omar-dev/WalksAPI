Regions (e.g., name, code, area, population)

Walks (e.g., name, length, difficulty)

🔐 Role-based Authentication & Authorization using JWT

📄 Entity Framework Core for database operations

🔍 Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination (Optional extensions)

🧪 Built-in Swagger UI for API testing and documentation

🌐 Follows REST principles and clean architecture
